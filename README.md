# Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling using Linked List

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements the **Shortest Job First (SJF)** CPU scheduling algorithm using a **custom Linked List–based Priority Queue in Java**.  
The system schedules processes based on the shortest execution (burst) time to minimize average waiting time.

This project is designed for **educational and academic purposes**, demonstrating the practical application of **Data Structures and Operating System concepts**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement the SJF CPU scheduling algorithm
- Design a linked list from scratch (without Java Collections)
- Create a priority queue sorted by execution time
- Calculate waiting time and turnaround time
- Simulate CPU scheduling via a console-based program

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Linked List Data Structure**
- **Priority Queue Logic**
- **Console-based UI**
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Add single or multiple processes
- Automatic sorting based on execution time (SJF)
- Waiting time & turnaround time calculation
- Sample test case execution
- Clean, menu-driven interface

---

## 🚫 Limitations
- All processes arrive at time 0
- Non-preemptive SJF only
- Console-based (no GUI)
